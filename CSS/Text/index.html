    <h1>Color in CSS</h1>
    <p>
        CSS
        Cascading Style Sheets:
        A lanaguage for describing how documents are presented visually,
        how they are aranged, and how they are styled.
    </p>

    <p>
        CSS rules:
        This is a basic pattern that is followed throughout CSS: <br>
        selector {
        property: value;
        }
    </p>

    <p>
        Example:
        Make all H1 elements on a page purple: <br>
        h1 {
        color: purple;
        }
    </p>

    <p>
        Make all image elements 100 pixels wide & 200 pixels tall: <br>
        img {
        width: 100px;
        height: 200px;
        }
    </p>


    <p>
        Select every other text input and give it a red border: <br>
        input[type="text"]:nth-of-type(2n){
        border: 2px solid red;
        }
    </p>

    <h2>Including Styles</h2>
    <p>
        Inline Styles:
        writing styles directly inline on each element (generally considered a bad practice)
    </p>

    <p>
        This approach is not recommened because it only applies to the element its written in.
        If you wanted to add multiple buttons and have them styled the same, you would have to
        add that "style" line to each button individually. Also you would not be able to share these
        styles between documents(different pages of the website).
    </p>

    <p>
        The style Element: The Style Element can be used inside of the head element in an HTML document. This approach
        is much better than using inline styles however,
        you still cant share styles between documents. In this example,
        we set a rule to change the colors of all H2's.
    </p>

    <p>
        External Stylesheet
        Write your styles in a .css file then include using a
        link element in the head of the HTML document. (Recommened)
    </p>

    <p>
        And in the css file: <br>
        h1{
        color: palegreen;
        }
    </p>


    <h3>Color Property</h3>
    <p>
        Sets a rule for text color.
        There are many ways to specify color.
        some examples include:
        color: purple
        color: #00ff00;
        color: rgb(214, 122, 127)
    </p>

    <p>
        Named Colors:
        Easy to use but is the most limited set.
        All browser recognize 140 named colors (these are constants).
    </p>

    <p>
        RGB Colors:
        An additive color model in which red, green, and blue light are added
        together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are red, green, and blue channels. Each channel ranging from 0-255 (0 being off) <br>
        red = rgb(255, 0, 0) <br>
        green = rgb(0, 255, 0) <br>
        blue = rgb(0, 0, 255) <br>
        purple = rgb(173, 20, 219) <br>
        black = rgb(0, 0, 0) <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        HEX Colors:
        Also comprised of red, green, and blue channels with a range of 0-255,
        but represented with a hexadecimal.
    </p>

    <p>
        The hexadecimal range: <br>
        least light(0) 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F most light(255) <br>
        red = #ff0000; green = #00ff00; blue = #0000ff; <br>
        Tip: If your hexcode features all of the same numbers #0011ff it can be shortened to #01f
    </p>
