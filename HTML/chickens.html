        <p>
            The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of
            wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl<sup>[1]</sup> that are originally from Southeast
            Asia.
            Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel.
        </p>

        <p>
            A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, and a sexually
            immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food
            (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets. Traditionally they were also bred for cockfighting,
            which is still practiced in some places.

            <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <p>
                An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster and an adult female is called a
                hen.
                Other terms are:
                Biddy: a newly hatched chicken
                Capon: a castrated or neutered male chicken
                Chick: a young chicken
            </p>

            <h2>Biology and habitat</h2>
            <p>
                Chickens are omnivores. In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds,
                insects, and even animals as large as lizards, small snakes, or sometimes young mice.
            </p>

            <h3>Behavior</h3>
            <h4>Social behaviour</h4>
            <p>
                Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to
                the incubation of eggs and raising of young.
            </p>
            <h4>Vocalizations</h4>
            <p>
                When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking
                in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food.
                This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them to eat.
